# ADR-003: Performance Optimization Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Deciders:** AutoDocOps Team

## Context

AutoDocOps needs to meet aggressive performance targets:
- API p95 response time < 200ms
- Database queries < 10ms
- First page load < 1.5s
- Support 100 concurrent repositories

## Decision

We will implement the following performance optimizations:

### Backend (.NET):
- **AOT Compilation**: Enable Native AOT for faster startup and smaller memory footprint
- **System.Text.Json Source Generators**: Compile-time JSON serialization for better performance
- **Npgsql Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections efficiently
- **Response Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use async/await everywhere

### Database (PostgreSQL):
- **Composite Indexes**: Optimize complex queries
- **UUID v7**: Better performance than UUID v4 for primary keys
- **Query Optimization**: Use LIMIT/OFFSET efficiently
- **Connection Pooling**: Configure optimal pool sizes

### Frontend (React/Expo):
- **Lazy Loading**: Load screens and components on demand
- **React 18 Features**: Concurrent rendering and Suspense
- **Code Splitting**: Bundle optimization
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format, responsive images

### Infrastructure:
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for static assets
- **Caching Headers**: 1-year cache for static assets
- **HTTP/2**: Better multiplexing and compression

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Meets performance targets
- Better user experience
- Reduced infrastructure costs
- Improved SEO scores

### Negative:
- Increased complexity in build process
- More monitoring requirements
- Potential for over-optimization

## Monitoring

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Synthetic monitoring for key user journeys
- Performance budgets in CI/CD
