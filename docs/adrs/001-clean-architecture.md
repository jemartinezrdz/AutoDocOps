# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Implementation

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Deciders:** AutoDocOps Team

## Context

AutoDocOps requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that supports rapid development while ensuring code quality and testability. The system needs to handle documentation generation for various project types with potential for future expansion.

## Decision

We will implement Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture) with the following structure:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, entities, value objects
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, interfaces, DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- **API Layer**: Controllers, middleware, configuration

### Key Technologies:
- **MediatR**: For implementing CQRS pattern and decoupling handlers
- **Mapster**: For object-to-object mapping
- **FluentValidation**: For input validation
- **Entity Framework Core**: For data access with PostgreSQL

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Clear separation of concerns
- High testability
- Independence from external frameworks
- Easier to maintain and extend
- SOLID principles compliance

### Negative:
- Slightly more complex initial setup
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with Clean Architecture
- More files and folders to manage

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Layered Architecture**: Simpler but less flexible
2. **Minimal API with no layers**: Fast to develop but hard to maintain
3. **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Good for smaller teams but less structure

## Implementation Details

- Use dependency injection for all external dependencies
- Implement interfaces in Domain/Application layers
- Keep Domain layer free of external dependencies
- Use Result pattern for error handling
