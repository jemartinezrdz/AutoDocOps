# ADR-004: Security Implementation Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Deciders:** AutoDocOps Team

## Context

AutoDocOps handles sensitive data including source code and user information. We need comprehensive security measures that comply with industry standards and provide defense in depth.

## Decision

We will implement multi-layered security:

### Authentication & Authorization:
- **Supabase Auth**: JWT-based authentication with Magic Link
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: PostgreSQL policies for data isolation
- **Token Rotation**: 24-hour token expiry with refresh mechanism

### Infrastructure Security:
- **TLS 1.3**: End-to-end encryption
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy headers
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

### Secrets Management:
- **Doppler**: Development and CI environments
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Production environment
- **No hardcoded secrets**: Code scanning for leaked credentials

### Data Protection:
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for backups
- **PII Filtering**: Remove sensitive data from logs
- **Data Retention**: 1-year retention policy
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data export and deletion capabilities

### Application Security:
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at API boundaries
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookies and CSRF tokens

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Comprehensive security coverage
- Compliance with security standards
- User trust and confidence
- Reduced risk of data breaches

### Negative:
- Increased complexity
- Performance overhead
- Additional operational burden

## Security Testing

- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Weekly vulnerability checks
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external assessments
- **Security Code Review**: Manual review for security-critical changes
