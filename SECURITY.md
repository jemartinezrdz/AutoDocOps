## Security Measures

### Code Security

- All code is reviewed before merging
- Automated security scanning with CodeQL, OWASP Dependency Check, and Trivy
- Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs

### Infrastructure Security

- All API endpoints require authentication
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- HTTPS-only communication in production
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Database connection strings are encrypted

### Data Protection

- Sensitive configuration data is stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Proper access controls on all data repositories
- Regular security audits

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Keys and Secrets

1. **Never commit API keys or secrets to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration**
3. **Rotate API keys regularly**
4. **Use least-privilege access principles**

### Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS in production**
2. **Keep dependencies updated**
3. **Enable security headers**
4. **Regular security monitoring**

### Configuration

1. **Change default passwords and secrets**
2. **Enable logging and monitoring**
3. **Use strong JWT secrets**
4. **Configure proper CORS settings**
